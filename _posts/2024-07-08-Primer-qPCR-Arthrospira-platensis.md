Why 16S rRNA is a Good Reference Gene for qPCR:
1. Highly Conserved Sequence:
The 16S rRNA gene has a highly conserved sequence across different species, including Arthrospira platensis. This conservation ensures that the gene's expression is stable and reliable for comparison across various experimental conditions.

2. Essential Cellular Function:
As a component of the ribosomal RNA, the 16S rRNA gene is crucial for protein synthesis in the ribosome. Its fundamental role in cellular function means its expression levels remain relatively constant, regardless of external conditions or treatments.

Why Photosystem II q(b) protein (A-PsQB gene) is a Good Response Gene for qPCR:
1. Involved in Photosynthetic Process:
The A-PsQB gene is involved in the photosynthetic process, which is highly responsive to environmental changes such as light intensity, quality, and stress conditions. This makes it an excellent gene to study changes in response to varying experimental treatments.

2. Indicator of Photosynthetic Efficiency:
As part of the photosystem II complex, the A-PsQB gene can serve as an indicator of photosynthetic efficiency and health in Arthrospira platensis. Its expression levels can provide insights into the physiological state of the organism under different conditions.
